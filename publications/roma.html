<h1>Abstract</h1>
Sequential decision-making tasks that require relating and using multiple novel objects pose significant sample-efficiency challenges for agents learning from sparse task rewards. In this work, we begin to address these challenges by leveraging an agent's object-interactions to define an auxilliary task that enables sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) of such tasks. To accomplish this, we formulate ROMA: a relational reinforcement learning agent that learns an object-centric forward model during task learning. We find that this enables it to learn object-interaction tasks much faster than other relational RL agents with alternative auxiliary tasks for driving good object-representation learning.  In order to evaluate the performance of our agent, we introduce a set of object-interaction tasks in the AI2Thor virtual home environment that require relating and interacting with multiple objects.  By comparing against an agent equipped with ground-truth object-information, we find that learning an object-centric forward model best closes the performance gap, achieving $\geq 80\%$ of its sample-efficiency on $7$ out of $8$ tasks, with the next best method doing so on $2$ out of $8$ tasks. Additionally, we find that our object-model best captures interesting object information such as category, specific object state, and relationships among objects.
