Wilka Carvalho is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Michigan--Ann Arbor where he is advised by [Honglak Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/), [Satinder Singh](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/), and [Richard L. Lewis](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/rickl.html). His long-term research goal is to develop cognitive theories of learning that help us understand how humans infer, reason with, and exploit the rich structure present in realistic visual scenes to enable sophisticated behavioral policies. Towards this end, he is studying how object-centric representation learning and reinforcement learning can bring us closer to human-level artificial intelligence. He is supported by an NSF Fellowship and the Rackham Merit Fellowship.
