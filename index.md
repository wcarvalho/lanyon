## Introduction

My name is Wilka[^1] Torrico De Carvalho and I am an Afro-Latino, socially sensitive, aspiring brain and machine learning scientist. I am interested in developing cognitive theories of learning that help us understand how humans infer, reason with, and exploit the rich structure present in realistic visual scenes to enable sophisticated behavioral policies. Some behaviors that I hope explain from a computational and mechanistic perspective include: 

* [how humans set their life goals and work towards them]({{ site.baseurl }}/questions), and 
* [why our representation scheme induces stereotypes and how this relates to our behavioral responses](https://medium.com/@wcarvalho92/success-vs-failure-generalization-vs-stereotyping-40de0713ab5d) (i.e. our [policies](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46260775/what-is-a-policy-in-reinforcement-learning#:~:text=A%20policy%20defines%20the%20learning,still%20didn't%20fully%20understand.)).

Towards this end, I am pursuing a PhD in Machine Learning at the University of Michigan where I study how **object-centric representation learning and reinforcement learning** can bring us closer to human-level artificial intelligence. My advisors are [Honglak Lee](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/) (representation learning), [Satinder Singh](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/) (reinforcement learning), and [Richard Lewis](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/rickl.html) (psychology). 

Here are my [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) and this is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tvJTXwoAAAAJ&hl=en). Here is a [third-person bio]({{ site.baseurl }}/misc/bio).

## Outreach

As a member of groups underrepresented in research and academia, outreach is important to me. I encourage all young scholars (especially those from marginalized backgrounds) to reach out to me with any questions. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) studying the mind, pursuing undergraduate research, applying for fellowships, and graduate school. Lastly, [increasing minority representation in STEM is important to me](https://medium.com/@wcarvalho92/a-statement-on-the-importance-of-representation-of-minority-groups-be400d98686). Please feel free to reach out if this applies to you or if you are organizing any relevant programs.

## Mentoring

I work on **unsupervised representation learning** and **reinforcement learning**. If you are interested in those topics and want to work with me or be mentored by me, please email me your CV and a brief 1-2 paragraph description including
* your interests
* your relevant goals
* what you seek to gain from working with me

I especially encourage underrepresented students to contact me. It's challenging to grow intellectually without a good source of guidance.

<!-- I recommend having experience implementing some basic models or algorithms. You can use [these resources]((https://wcarvalho.github.io/ML-Brain-Resources/)) to self-study material. -->

## Miscellaneous
I also maintain a collection of resources for 
* [pursuing a PhD/Graduate School](https://wcarvalho.github.io/Phd-Resources/) (writing resources, career advice, and funding resources)
* [learning about/doing research in machine learning, computational cognitive science, and computational neuroscience](https://wcarvalho.github.io/ML-Brain-Resources/) (including online courses in mathematics, AI, neuroscience, and cognitive science)

Last, [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiwW8O29uDV9gfpaAh0MNGEQTKykGw) are some papers I want to read, am reading, or have read, along with some notes. For whoever might find this useful!
